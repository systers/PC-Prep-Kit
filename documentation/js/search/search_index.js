Each active repo has its own channel to direct questions to (for example #powerup or #portal).  \nRemember that this is an inclusive community, committed to creating a safe, positive environment.  See the full Code of Conduct.General Guidelines\n\nIf you’re just getting started work on an issue labeled “First Timers Only” in any project. Additional resources are available on our website.\nIn an active repository (not an archived one), choose an open issue from the issue list, claim it in the comments, and a maintainer will assign it to you.  \nAfter approval you must make continuous notes on your progress in the issue while working.  If there is not at least one comment every 3 days, the maintainer can reassign the issue.\nWhen sending a PR have an appropriate title referencing the issue which it solves. Add “fixes #” in the commit body, so that when the PR gets merged, the issue gets closed automatically. Do not do this if the PR solves only a part of the issue. See more information on commit guidelines here.\nIf you’d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues. \nHave a short description on what has gone wrong (like a root cause analysis and description of the fix), if that information is not already present in the issue.\nIf you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n

application aimed at helping the peace corps volunteers with awareness about Malaria and its prevention techniques. The application uses various interactive activities to make the process effective. The App focuses on causes, prevention and medication of Malaria.\nWhy is the project useful?\nPC Prep kit helps spread awareness about Malaria. According to WHO[1], In 2015 there were around 212 million cases of malaria and 429,000 deaths, 90% of which is from Africa.  It is established that early diagnosis and prompt treatment of malaria prevents deaths. Taking simple preventive measures can also help in preventing malaria to a large extent. The Peace Corps Volunteers who travel to the countries effected with malaria can use the information proved in the application and learn about symptoms, medications and their side effects and preventive measure which help keep them safe. \nTechnologies used\nThe project uses \n\nNode.js, Express framework (JavaScript)\nAngular 4 (SCSS, TypeScript, HTML)\nMocha, Supertest, Should.js (Backend Testing)\nJasmine, Karma (Angular Testing)\nMySQL + Sequalize ORM \nESLint and TSLint (Linting tools)\n\nHow can users get started with contributing to the project?\nAnyone can find an issue in the application, the issue is not limited to bugs but also includes UI enhancements, efficient codes, improved structure or updating depreciated functions.  \nThe following procedure must be followed in order to solve an issue.    \n\nCheck if the issue has already been reported, if not report the issue on Github.\nAssign the issue to yourself, if you want to solve it.  \nYou can open an issue and tag it as free if you do not wish to solve it. \nThe issues marked free are open for you to solve, assign the issue to yourself before beginning the work on it. \nBefore you make a Pull request, make sure that there are no linting errors with the files you modified.\n\nGetting Started\nFork the Repository\nOn GitHub, navigate to the PC-Prep-Kit Repository.\nIn the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.\nClone the Repository\nNow, navigate to the forked repository in your profile.\nIn the top-right corner of the page, you will find a green button with the text \"Clone or download\". Click on it.\nCopy the link that appears in the popup.\nNow, go to your terminal (if you are using a Linux platform) or git bash (if you are using a Windows platform) and execute this command\ngit clone URLReplace URL with the copied url\nor you can just,\nGo to your terminal and execute this command\n$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PC-Prep-KitReplace YOUR_USERNAME with your Github username.\nInstallation\nInstall all dependencies in package.json file. This can be done by navigating to the cloned PC-Prep-Kit directory in the command prompt/terminal/console and running the following command:\n$ cd PC-Prep-Kit\n$ npm installEdit the settings.js file inside the config folder with your custom API keys and database setup information.\nCreate a new tab in your terminal/command line and in there log in to your local MySQL account and follow the steps below:\nCREATE DATABASE pcprepkit;or if you are using a tool like phpMyAdmin to manage your database, you can setup it up there too.\nSetting up api.ai for doctor chat module\n\nSignup on api.ai with the same google project used for gmail login. \nCreate a new agent. \nOn the sidebar, click on the settings icon adjacent to the agent name. \nOpen Export and Import tab and select import from zip. \nupload the malariaDoctor.zip file available in the repo. \nget the client key from the console and replace it in settings.js file\n\nOnce the database and the settings.json file is setup, run the following command from the project directory.\n$ npm startThen create a new terminal or command line tab and go to the project directory and run\n$ ng build --watchto setup the Angular developmental server.\nAfter the build completes, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to check out the application. \nAnd, that's it, you are DONE. You have successfully setup the project.\nThe app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nTesting\nBackend Testing\nBackend Testing uses mocha, supertest and should.js, these packages are installed automatically from the package.json file and will be available after all the packages are installed by running npm install.The test file is available in test/test.js.To contribute to the backend testing for PC Prep Kit, you can search for APIs for which the test cases have not been written, or validity of current tests due to any API changes.   \nAngular (Frontend) Testing\nFrontend Testing uses Karma and Jasmine, these packages are installed automatically from the package.json file and will be available after all the packages are installed by running npm install.\nThe test files are available in the src/tests/ folder.\nSteps to run the tests:\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nTo contribute to the frontend testing for PC Prep Kit, you can look for files for which the test cases have not been written, or fix test cases that fail. \nRunning TSLint and ESLint\nRun ng lint in your terminal to identify all linting errors with Angular files. \nYou can also run tslint PATH_TO_YOUR_typescript_FILE to check for linting errors of individual files.\nRun eslint *.js; eslint **/*.js in your terminal to identify all linting errors with Node files. \nYou can also run eslint PATH_TO_YOUR_nodejs_FILE to check for linting errors of individual files.\nNeed more help?\nHelp on using Git\nTo get more help on the angular-cli use ng --help or go check out the Angular-CLI README.\nRun npm install --save PACKAGE_NAME to install packages locally and add it to package.json file.\nOr\nRun npm install -g PACKAGE_NAME to install packages globally and use it across all node projects.\nReplace PACKAGE_NAME with the actual name of the package.\nStill having trouble installing npm packages. You can learn more about it  here.\nGet help on Sequelize here.\nWhere can users get help with the project?\nUsers can post their questions on the Slack Channel group pc-prep-kit or use the Mailing List . \n[1] WHO - 10 facts about malaria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
