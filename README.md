## Getting Started

#### Fork the Repository
On GitHub, navigate to the PC-Prep-Kit Repository.
In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

#### Clone the Repository
Now, navigate to the forked repository in your profile.
In the top-right corner of the page, you will find a green button with the text "Clone or download". Click on it.
Copy the link that appears in the popup.

Now, go to your terminal (if you are using a Linux platform) or git bash (if you are using a Windows platform) and execute this command

```
git clone URL
```

Replace URL with the copied url

or you can just,

Go to your terminal and execute this command

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PC-Prep-Kit
```
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your Github username.

### Installation

Install all dependencies in package.json file. This can be done by navigating to the cloned PC-Prep-Kit directory in the command prompt/terminal/console and running the following command:

```
$ cd PC-Prep-Kit
$ npm install
```

Edit the `settings.js` file inside the config folder with your custom API keys and database setup information.

Create a new tab in your terminal/command line and in there log in to your local MySQL account and follow the steps below:

```
CREATE DATABASE pcprepkit;
```

or if you are using a tool like phpMyAdmin to manage your database, you can setup it up there too.

Once the database is setup, run the following command from the project directory.

```
$ npm start
```

Then create a new terminal or command line tab and go to the project directory and run

```
$ npm run watch
```

to setup the Angular developmental server.

After the build completes, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to check out the application.

And, that's it, you are DONE. You have successfully setup the project.

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Testing
#### Backend Testing
Backend Testing uses mocha, supertest and should.js, these packages are installed automatically from the package.json file and will be available after all the packages are installed by running `npm install`.
The test file is available in test/test.js.
To contribute to the backend testing for PC Prep Kit, you can search for APIs for which the test cases have not been written, or validity of current tests due to any API changes.

#### Angular (Frontend) Testing
Frontend Testing uses Karma and Jasmine, these packages are installed automatically from the package.json file and will be available after all the packages are installed by running `npm install`.
The test files are available in the src/tests/ folder.

Steps to run the tests:
Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via Karma.

To contribute to the frontend testing for PC Prep Kit, you can look for files for which the test cases have not been written, or fix test cases that fail.

#### Running TSLint and ESLint

Run `npm run lint` in your terminal to identify all linting errors with Angular files.

You can also run `tslint PATH_TO_YOUR_typescript_FILE` to check for linting errors of individual files.

Run `eslint *.js; eslint **/*.js` in your terminal to identify all linting errors with Node files.

You can also run `eslint PATH_TO_YOUR_nodejs_FILE` to check for linting errors of individual files.
